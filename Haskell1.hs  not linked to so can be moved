-- Data Flow Map (from Day 5 with T)
-- Query Ingestion: HTTP POST to Bo-Hive endpoint, parse request params (query text, stake amount, timeout), generate unique queryID and commitment window. 
-- Worker Distribution: Broadcast queryID to active Worker-Bos. Each Worker: generates answer, computes SHA-256 hash, stakes ADA collateral, submits hash to chain. 
-- Reveal Phase: Workers publish plaintext + original hash, Drone-Bos verify hash matches, invalid reveals auto-slashed.
